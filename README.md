You can specify numbers as 1_2_3_4 for better readability.

You can also specify prefixed numbers in their base format like 0b111 = 7 or 0xF = 15. This is nice.
single quotes cannot be interchanged with double quotes. Single quote is for character literals
Use backquote(`) for string literals with special characters , multiline etc
